# komodo_xmpp_lib from Komodo Chat Investama

komodo library for xmpp (Android/iOS)

## Getting Started

This library is intended to be a full-featured Flutter library for XMPP/Jabber based on the
leading platforms for Android/iOS.   It is part of Komodo Chat and is released to the community
as a service and to help pay back into the system that helps us all create great software.

This is based on the great work of Aldi Ferdiyan.  You find the original library at
https://github.com/aldiferdiyan/flutter_xmpp.  If you don't need cross platform or access to
our servers check out his library flutter_xmpp.   This library does include functionality for
non-standard functions and for iOS - which is not useful to many users.

- Android support is complete
- iOS support is pending hardware for us
